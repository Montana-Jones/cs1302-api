## Part 1: App Description

> The Random Movie App is a fun way to pick a movie for anyone who loves
> movies as much as I do. It doesn't matter if they're indie films or
> Marvel movies, anyone is welcome here. In an attempt to keep this app
> safe for work, I've filtered out any movies rated R or higher. With that
> in mind, some suggestive posters may still pop up (because between years
> 1970 and 1995, studios just put whatever rating they wanted on movies).
> I do apologize in advance if these images pop up, but there's only so
> much I can do to prevent them. The way the app works is that the user is
> first greeted with an information window with instructions on how to use
> the app (select a year/genre/both/neither and click the button to generate
> a random movie. If some error occurs behind the scenes, an alert window is
> generated. While the APIs are working through the requests, the default
> film poster cycles through some of my favorite film posters.
> The first API called is the IMDb API (https://imdb-api.com/api) which finds
> a random movie based on the user's choices. It then takes the IMDb ID of
> that film and sends a request to the second API: the OMDb API
> (https://www.omdbapi.com/) and gives the long version of the plot for the
> movie. The IMDb API does have a plot variable, however it isn't a very
> detailed plot, so the OMDb offers more substance (and potentially spoilers,
> sorry!)

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

> I got a better grasp on getting information from APIs and how to
> use Math.random to prevent duplicate results.


## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

> I would research more on how to make the interface look nicer.
> I'm very proud of the app I created but it could definitely
> look a little nicer.
